# Human Activity Recognition

This project aims to recognize human activities from images using a deep learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with transfer learning from the VGG16 model. The project is designed to classify images into one of four defined activities:

Reading a Book

Riding a Bicycle

Watching a Sunrise or Sunset

Listening to music
